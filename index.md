# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Josias Huang and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Science.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was a favorite because I previously had felt like all the labs had been pretty simplistic. This lab was simplistic, but I found a more efficient way to code it than I usually would have. Learning how to do things in an efficient way is always ideal for a programmer, so the experience was well appreciated.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I was very relieved when doing it. I absolutely loathed not using functions in the previous labs. As an experienced programmer I used functions to make my code more efficient and organized; not having these tools was quite irksome. I also enjoyed making the blackjack game, I got to see multiple ways others had done it and the different styles had itrigued me.

* Lab 8
    Finally Lab 8, part 2 was another favorite; due to the use of files. Previously in java I had used files for all sorts of things, but in c++ they worked a little differently. I had never saved a file onto a computer in java before, so doing it in this lab had piqued intrested me. As a computer Scientist I am always so interested in finding more efficient and different ways to use code, so actually learning something new in this class made me very excited.
